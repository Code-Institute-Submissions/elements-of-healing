## Introduction

[Elements of Healing](https://elements-of-healing.herokuapp.com/) is a website that is avaliable to the general public. It is designed to appeal to users seeking homeopathic treatment or who have a general interest in holistic medicine and more specifically **homeopathic treatment**. The site is designed to provide four core services:

1. To educate users who have an interest in holisitic medicine, but little or no knowledge of homeopathy, with an understanding of it's health benefits and key healing principles e.g The law of similars.

2. To provide users who are interested in homeopathic treatment with an understanding of how a homeopathic consultation works, my background as a holistic healer and homeopathic qualifications. Also to provide these users with a means of contacting me should they have further questions about homeopathy, my homeopathic practice or how a homeopathic consultation works.

3. To provide new/regular clients who want a homeopathic treatment with a means to provisionally book a homeopathic consultation with myself.

4. To provide users (primarily existing homeopathy clients) with the ability to self-treat acute illnesses by purchasing homeopathic remedies and remedy kits from the online store.

- Link up the purchase of appointments with the confirmation of appointments.

- There are several small javascript errors that need to be fixed.

- The copyright statement fails to appear when the page is first downloaded. This has been temporarily fixed by adding a default HTML copyright statement and inserting the current year as a template variable. However a permanent javascript solution needs to be found.

- Add a blog site to the website that can be viewed by registered users. 

- Add video media to the site so online remote appointments can be offered to registered users.

- The python code in many views has become quite complicated and needs reorganising.

## Testing

### Testing Stories

- The following error message  `NameError at /checkout/ - name 'basket' is not defined` occurred during the final implementation of the checkout app. This was caused by the basket session variable being incorrectly named 'bag' in the checkout view.

- The potency value of purchased remedies failed to appear in either the shopping basket or on the checkout page. This was caused by the form value name for 'potency' being incorrectly named as 'product_potency' in the add_to_basket view.

- The error message `Field 'id' expected a number but got 'checkout'.` occurred when clicking on the 'Secure Checkout' button to purchase items in the shopping basket. This error occurred because of an error in the structuring of my url naming. The project level url was changed from '' to 'checkout/' and the checkout app level url was changed from 'checkout/wh' to 'wh/' to fix this problem.

- A problems occurred when customising the layout of my projects allauth forms. Forms with only a small amount of content would have a limited height which would break the pages layout. The footer section would be forced up the page and the page background image would be visible beneath it. To fix this problem the allauth base.html template was replaced with the form_base.html and message_base.html template. The message_base.html template would contain classnames that uses min-height with viewpoint units and the transform: translate property to center the page content. This prevented the limited content breaking the page layout.

- The following error message `NoReverseMatch at /accounts/logout/ , Reverse for 'home' not found. 'home' is not a valid view function or pattern name` occurred when the user clicks on the login button. This was fixed by changing the name for the root url from index to home.

- The following error message `AttributeError at /profile/, 'UserProfile' object has no attribute 'orders'` occurred when the current user clicks on the 'My Profile' link. This was fixed by adding the user_profile field to the Order model in the checkout app.

- The error message `NoReverseMatch at /add/, Reverse for 'add_product' with arguments '(43,)' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried: ['products/add/$']` occurred when a product was being deleted. This was caused by the incorrect view `view.update_product` being used in the app level url path. This was changed to the correct view `views.delete_product`.

- The error message `NoReverseMatch at /products/add/, Reverse for 'add_product' with arguments '(44,)' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried: ['products/add/$']` occurred because the redirect was pointing back to the add_product view when it should have been pointing to the product_detail view. 

- The error message `404 Not Found` occurred when remove link is clicked in shopping basket. This was fixed by changing the url variable from `/remove/${itemId}/` to `basket/remove/${itemId}/`.

- Conditional statement was failing to prevent the addition of more than one appointment to the basket. This was fixed by changing the if statement from `if quantity > 1` to `if item_id in list(basket.keys())`

- When navigating to the homepage a http 500 internal server error occurred with the following error message `KeyError at /, 'appointment_details'`. This error was traced back to the basket context.py file and was fixed by replacing `appointment_details = request.session['appointment_details]` with `appointment_details = request.session.get('appointment_details', {})`.

- When adding a product to the shopping basket a http 500 internal server error occurred with the following error message `KeyError at /basket/add/22/, 'appointment_details'`. This error was traced back to the add_to_basket view and was fixed by replacing `appointment_de
tails = request.session['appointment_details]` with `appointment_details = request.session.get('appointment_details', {})`.

- Found a security problem with the shopping basket. The appointment form input field is designated as readonly to prevent more than one appointment being entered at a time. However this can be overridden by the client using the developer tools. This was fixed by resetting the appointment quantity to 1 in the checkout view.

- Tested appointment booking / email using the temporary email website `https://temp-mail.org` and my gmail account.

- Tested shopping basket & checkout pages using temporary email website `https://temp-mail.org` and Stripes payment page.

- Error message when using the contact form  `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2020-11-30'`. This was fixed by replacing `datetime.today()` with `datetime.today().year` which provided necessary integer value without the need for extra steps which were causing the error above.

- `Server Error (500)` & `ProgrammingError at /contact/` occurs when navigating to contact form after deployment to heroku.This was caused by migration changes not being added to postgres database. These Errors were fixed by adding DATABASE_URL to gitpod environment variables so that migration changes were updated to postgres rather than mysqlite database.

- When an appointment is purchased & an appointment is already in the shopping basket the 'remove' link for that appointment stops working.  The following error `Internal Server Error: "POST /basket/remove/2/ HTTP/1.1" 500 0` is displayed in the terminal. This was fixed by adding a conditional statement to the appointments view and add_to_basket view to check if the basket already contains an appointment. If it does it redirects to the basket page instead of trying to add a new appointment and breaking the link. 

- When an appointment is deleted from the shopping basket, the appointment is still displayed on the calendar. This was fixed by adding the calendar appointment `id number` to the `appointment_details` session variable. This could then be used to delete the appointment from the calendar if the appointment was removed from the basket. Two other session variables, `confirmed` & `eventID` were used to delete the corresponding google calendar event if the appointment was removed from the basket.

## How to add Google Calendar API

### Create a New Google Calendar API Project

1. Go to the [Google Developer Console]( https://console.developers.google.com)

2. To create a new google developer project click on the dropdown link in the navbar then select `NEW PROJECT`.

3. In the search form enter `google calendar api` and select ` Google Calendar API`. Then click `ENABLE`.

4. In the sidebar click on the link `Credentials` followed by `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS`. Then select the authorisation method named `OAuth client ID`.

5. In the `Application type` dropdown menu select `Desktop app`, change the default name for your OAuth 2.0 client if you wish, then click `CREATE`.

6. A pop message will appear telling you that you OAuth client has been created. Your new client id and your client secret will also be displayed. Click OK.

7. In the credentials page under the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs section, your new OAuth client should be visible. Click on the download icon on the far right to download a copy of your `client_secret.json` file.


### Add Credentials to Connect Your Project to the Google Calendar API

In the terminal run the following command to install the library using pip3:

1. Check that you have the following libraries installed in your project (they should have been installed during deployment):

- google-api-python-client
- google-auth-httplib2
- google-auth-oauthlib

2. If they aren't installed run the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

3. Place your `client_secret.json` file in the root directory of your project.

4. Create a file called `googleCalendarAPI.py` as follows:
```
from apiclient.discovery import build

from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow

import pickle


scopes = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']

flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file("client_secret.json", scopes=scopes)

credentials = flow.run_console()

pickle.dump(credentials, open(‘token.pkl’, ‘wb’))
```

5. Run the python script in the terminal from the root of your project:
```
python3 googleCalendarAPI.py
```

6. Click on the url address in the terminal then sign in with your google account credentials when prompted.

7. Click `Allow` to grant permissions to see, edit, share and delete your google calendars (you may need to go into advanced settings to do this).

8. Copy the authorization code that is generated and paste it into the terminal where it says: `Enter the authorization code:`

9. This should create a file called `token.pkl` in your root directory which will allow your project to connect to the google calendar api.

10. For security purposes, you should now delete the `client_secret.json` file. You can also delete the `googleCalendarAPI.py` script.

11. If you make any changes to your current scope settings you will need to delete the current token file and use the client_secret.json to generate a new token file.
